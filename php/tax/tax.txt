Hi Eseza, 
Well I think with the rtsmotors, it's a very good idea. I will wait for the link and I see how far we have gone. What I forgot was the formula for the taxes.
 So here you go: 
Above 8years( surcharge)
73.5\100 x value x exchange rate + 1000000+ 18000.
the exchange rate is currently 2330, but u can still add up 1m + 18000 instead of separating them. 
Below 8years 
Same formula with 53.5 instead.
Note: every year there those that fall into the category of surcharge.
For the trucks from 2ton and above.
I am not so sure, but it's something like 
38% then the rest is fine but when it comes to registration u make it 1.5m 

Any progress yet? When can I have a look at it.
